This file contains the plan for my Breakout Game.

Opinions on other versions of breakout:

Circus - I thought the circus game was very successful in its use of physics.  I liked that the characters jumped in
arcs and that it mattered where the character landed on the see-saw.  Specifically, I thought it was a nice touch to
make it so if the character didn't land at a rather ideal part of the see-saw the character wouldn't jump high enough to
 eliminate any blocks.

Vortex - Vortex had the most interesting graphics of any of the games to me.  I thought the circular nature and the
sense of depth that was created on the screen was very visually appealing but would be too difficult for me to implement
.  However, I did not like that the ball would just break through the bricks and continue along their path instead of
bouncing off the bricks that it hit.  I was also unsure how the laser was used.  I like that the laser in theory could
allow the user to eliminate bricks with more control but I am unsure how it actually functioned in the vortex game.  I
also liked that the levels had a time limit.  I think this could be an easy way to increase or decrease the difficulty
of any given level.

Centipong - Centipong's rules were not immediately clear to me just from watching the game.  I was unsure as to what the
 objective of the game was which I think is a bad sign.  However, I thought the physics behind how the balls bounce off
 the paddle was well implemented.  I liked how the ball bounce depended on the paddle's speed and direction.
 Furthermore, the power-ups in Centipong were interesting.  I liked when there were a bunch of balls on the screen at
 the same time and I plan to implement a similar feature in my game.

Pinball Breakout - I thought it was an interesting idea to have different kinds of paddles and pinball flappers in the
same game.  I think the controls would be difficult for the player but the idea is pretty ambitious and cool.  On the
other hand, the way that the flappers were positioned made it unlikely that they could ever really be used which was
unfortunate.  I like the idea of possibly having multiple paddles on the screen at one time as a power up.
